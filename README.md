# International University Schedule Generator

Every semester, students at my university choose subjects for the next semester. The time to study of each subject combined create a schedule. However, each subject often has several choices for time to study. Changing the time of one subject can lead to a whole different schedule.

This led to a lot of time wasted every semester to find out all schedules in order to evaluate each of them and make the right subject choices. 

IU Schedule Generator aims to solve that by providing a quick and easy way for student to input all subjects together with their time to study and then return all possible schedules.
